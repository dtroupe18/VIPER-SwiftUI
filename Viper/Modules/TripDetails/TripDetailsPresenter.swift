     This code:

     [1] Creates a binding to set the trip name. The TextField will use this in the
     view to be able to read and write from the value.

     [2] Assigns the trip name from the interactorâ€™s publisher to the tripName property
     of the presenter. This keeps the value synchronized.

     Separating the trip name into properties like this allows you to synchronize
     the value without creating an infinite loop of updates.
